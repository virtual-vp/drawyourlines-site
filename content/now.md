Right now I'm figuring out how to share what I know in a way that's useful to others without turning this into a free consulting hotline.

Some of what I've built has real value: frameworks, mental models, and hard-won lessons from transformation work. I want to share openly where it makes sense, and be thoughtful about the rest.

This site is an experiment in that balance. I'm learning as I go, and tightening the signal with every post.
