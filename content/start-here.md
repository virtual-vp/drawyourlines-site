This site is where I share what I've learned building and running cloud systems. Not theory. Not vendor marketing. Actual experience from the field.

If you're looking for polished frameworks or certification prep, this probably isn't your place. If you want honest takes from someone who's done the work, stick around.

You'll find posts on operating models, execution, and the moments where “good enough” quietly becomes expensive.

Start with [The Line](/posts/the-line/) to understand why this site exists.
