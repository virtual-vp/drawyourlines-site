I've spent years in the trenches of enterprise infrastructure and cloud transformation. I've seen what works, what doesn't, and what vendors conveniently leave out of their pitch decks. Real systems. Real constraints. Real consequences when ‘good enough’ fails.

This site reflects a simple belief: experience matters. In a world obsessed with the newest shiny thing, practical knowledge from people who've actually done the work is undervalued.

We all need boundaries. We need to know what we value and separate signal from noise. We need to draw our lines—whether straight, curved, or full of hard angles.

That's what this site is for.
